## Production Deployment
Want a FHIR Server that supports profiles established throughout the dot.base project? The easiest way is to deploy our docker stack for that. Just follow the steps below to get started.

‚ùó This setup is meant for folks that just want to deploy the dot.base FHIR Server including a database. If you want to deploy an instance of the whole dot.base project see the [central dot.base repository](https://github.com/dot-base/dot-base).

[![Docker Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/We%20love-Docker-blue?style=flat&logo=Docker)](https://github.com/orgs/dot-base/packages)

### Requirements
- [Docker Engine >= v1.13](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

or to run the project locally:
 - Oracle Java (JDK) installed: Minimum JDK11 or newer.
 - Apache Maven build tool (newest version)


### Deployment
1. Create a docker swarm if you don't already have one:
    ```
    docker swarm init
    ```
1. Start both, a FHIR Server as well as a database container:
    ```
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dot-base/fhir-server/master/docker-compose.yml --output docker-compose.yml
    docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml fhir-server
    ```
1. Set the following environment variables on your production system. We advice auto generating a secure password and choosing a different username than `admin` ;).
    ```sh
    export HAPI_FHIR_SERVER_ADDRESS="YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS"
    export SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL="YOUR_DB_URL"
    export SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME="YOUR_DB_USER"
    export SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD="YOUR_DB_PW"
    export IDENTITY_PROVIDER_REALM: "YOUR_SSO_REALM_ADRESS"
    ```
    The following environment variables can be set optionally, depending on your setup:
    ```sh
    export ERROR_MONITORING_ENABLED: "true"
    export SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT: "YOUR_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT"
    export SENTRY_DSN: "YOUR_SENTRY_DSN"
    export PROXY_ADDRESS: "YOUR_PROXY_ADDRESS"
    export PROXY_PORT: "YOUR_PROXY_PORT"
    ```
1. Done and dusted üéâ. This will deploy two containers: a dot.base fhir server as well as a postgres database container.
1. [optional] Add these containers to your docker swarm or kubernetes config. Hint: You can use the `docker-compose.yml` as a template for this.

‚ùó Per default, port 8080 of the FHIR server container is exposed. You can change that, and other deployment options inside the docker-compose.yml. Remember to redeploy the stack after updating that file.


## Contributing

### Requirements
- [Java JDK >= v11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Maven >= v3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Docker Engine >= v1.13](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- A local copy of this repository

### Running Locally
1. Create a docker swarm if you don't already have one:
    ```
    docker swarm init
    ```
2. 
    a) Start a database container and start the development server separately:

        docker stack deploy -c docker-compose-dev-db.yml fhir-db
        mvn jetty:run

    b) or start the the full setup with docker

        docker stack deploy -c docker-compose-dev.yml fhir-server-dev

4. By default the server is available at http://localhost:8080.
5. By default authentication will be enabled, but can be disabled in ```application.yaml``` or ```docker-compose-dev.yml```.
6. Go and mix up some code üë©‚Äçüíª. The server will reload automatically once you save. Remember to keep an eye on the console.

### Authentication
If ```AUTHENTICATION_INTERCEPTOR_ENABLED``` is set to ```true```, you must specify your identity providers realm url, to fetch a public key and requests must include one of the following headers

    Authorization - Bearer sometoken...
    X-Forwarded-User - username

You can disable this property in the application.yaml
